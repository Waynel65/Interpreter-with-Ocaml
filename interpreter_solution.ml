Honor code comes here:

BU ID:

I pledge that this program represents my own
program code and that I have coded on my own. I received
help from no one in designing and debugging my program.
I have read the course syllabus of CS 320 and have read the sections on Collaboration
and Academic Misconduct. I also understand that I may be asked to meet the instructor
or the TF for a follow up interview on Zoom. I may be asked to explain my solution in person and
may also ask you to solve a related problem.
